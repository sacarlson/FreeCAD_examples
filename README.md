# FreeCAD_examples
I plan to put all my FreeCAD projects I create here, my first being a PCP air gun that shoots peas or most any round projectiles 8mm or less.  

This is the first time I ever tried FreeCAD that with about a one week learning curve this is what I was finally able to produce.  I have to admit that I got stuck for a few days and almost gave it up.  But after I firgured out that you need to add planes that you add on top of your objects to add or subtract to and from them.  These planes can be added at any angle and can be moved in it's relitive x/y plane to add new scetches that are paded to add and pocked to remove material like an extrution.   After I firgured this out it all fell together with little effort.  I also found a lot of support on youtube for any questions I had I found very good examples of how things could be done.  So when in dought check out some of the youtube videos on FreeCAD.

As far as my first project being a PCP air rifle
  I had to wonder why I didn't see any PCP air rifles or guns of any kind on github or anyplace on the web for that matter.  I did some minimal research and note that gun drawing designs are restricted on github but PCP air guns and or rifles seem to be acceptable.  If I failed to understand the restrictions I will be happy to remove this project from github.  The parts I created for my PCP rifle are only what I needed to complete what was already available in public web markets including lazada for me.

The web available parts for this project for me included:

1. The airvalve and airtank assy
   In my design this part is NOT fully detailed .  It was puchased on lazada and I just created a shell of the part here so that I could integrate it into the the parts that I created.  I think it's a replacement part for a paint gun that was exactly what I needed at a reasonable price.  At some point we could add details to this part but my guess it would only add to the time and cost unless you just wanted to make the entire assembly yourself, if you had all the tools needed.  I also think it might require a few attempts to get it right.  Using a proven working part should make it easy.

2. the barrel of this rifel
   This part was also available on lazada made of stainless steel with the outer and iner diameter being exatly what I needed.  It is not a rifled barrel and I do not have any plans to add them.  I only use balls for projectils that work fine for me.  but the accuracy I need is only hitting a coconut tree from 60 meters.  So if you want better accuacy you might research rifling if your into that. 8mm barings also work if you want more power.

   The main 4 parts of this project were sent to pwbway in step file format to have them CNC them.  I made the body out of the cheapist aluminum and the hammer plug and bolt I had them make them out of the cheapist steel.  After I already sent them the files I already think I see an error I might have made.  there may not be enough play in the hole to mount the airvalve assy.  As of the time I wrote this the parts have not been delivered so we will just have to wait and see what might need to be done to get it to fit.
  I had original ideas of purchasing a small lathe and a small mill that is all that would be needed to create the parts myself but later decided to first try PCBway.  My guess was this would be the only assebly I would ever make with the tools and they would end up costing more time and money and taking up more space than I can't afford.
